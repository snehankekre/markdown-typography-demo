# Smart Markdown typography demo

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://markdown-typography-demo.streamlit.app)

This demo showcases the smart typography features that could be integrated into Streamlit's [`st.markdown`](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/text/st.markdown).

Enter text in the box to see how specific character sequences are automatically transformed.

Examples to try:
- Enter `->` to see it transform into a right arrow (→)
- Enter `<-` for a left arrow (←)
- Type `--` to get an em dash (—)
- Type `>=` for a greater than or equal to sign (≥)
- Type `<=` for a less than or equal to sign (≤)
- Use `~=` for approximately equal to (≈)
- Try `-->` for a long right arrow (⟶)
- Try `<--` for a long left arrow (⟵)
- Use `<->` for a left-right arrow (↔)
- Type `<-->` for a long left-right arrow (⟷)
